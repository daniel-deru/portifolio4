This means site admins don't need to waste time changing small stuff like prices and also don't need to be worried about the client breaking the site after changing a setting accidentally or needing to train the client on how to use WordPress as the interface is easy to understand. **I have explicit consent to display this project**. This product falls under the GPL license which is why I can add it to my portfolio. The source code is legally allowed to be distributed because of the license but due to this being a commercial product I will not have a link to the source code. You can however test it out in a playground.",
